# The Big Mac Index

This repository contains the data behind _The Economist’s_ Big Mac index, and code that shows how we calculate it. To download the data, go to the [latest release][latest release], where you can download the index data in a CSV or Excel, or the code behind it.

## Source data

Our source data come from several places. We get Big Mac prices from McDonalds directly and from reporting around the world. Exchange rates come from Reuters. GDP and population data used to calculate the Euro area averages comes from Eurostat; per-capita GDP data come from the IMF World Economic Outlook reports.

## Output data

The script provides data in three files:
 
- `big-mac-raw-index.csv` contains values for the “raw” index
- `big-mac-adjusted-index.csv` contains values for the “adjusted” index
- `big-mac-full-index.csv` contains both

Each file also contains the source data used to calculate it.

## Calculating the Big Mac Index

The code to calculate the index is provided in a [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter]. The code itself is written in R, a programming language designed for data manipulation and statistics. You can view the [notebook][notebook link] on github.

If you want to run our code, you’ll need to set up a few things:

### Install Python

You can refer to the installation instructions at the [Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python][h2g2py install]

**On a Mac**, you already have Python 2.7 installed, but it does not come with Python’s package manager. We recommend using Python 3. To install it, we recommend using [Homebrew][homebrew]. In terminal, install Homebrew:

```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, use Homebrew to install Python 3.x:

```
$ brew install python3
```

**On Ubuntu Linux** you can use aptitude:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

**On Windows**, instructions coming.

### Install Jupyter

**On Mac or Linux**, you should now also have pip installed. pip is a package manager for Python. You can install [Jupyter][jupyter] with pip:

```
$ python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

You’re all set. (If you are using Python 2, run `python -m pip install jupyter`.)

**On Windows**, instructions coming.

### Install R

**On a Mac**, use Homebrew again. At a terminal prompt, run:

```
$ brew install R
```

**On Ubuntu Linux**, you’re recommended to add a new source to your aptitude setup to install R. Run:

```
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
```

Once you have added the key, add R repository (called CRAN):

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386] https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/'
```

Now, you can install R:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install r-base
```

**On Windows**, instructions coming.

### Install IRkernel

[IRKernel][irkernel] lets you run R code in Jupyter notebooks. This is the best way to work with R code[^There may be some argument on this point, but it is silly and this statement is obviously correct.]. Installation instructions for IRKernel are [here][irkernel installation]. In short:

At a terminal prompt, start R:
```
$ R
> install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest'))
> devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
> IRkernel::installspec()
```

Congratulations, you can run R in Jupyter.

### Install tidyverse, data.table, countrycode

Finally, our R script uses a few R packages you’ll need to install. The [tidyverse][tidyverse] is a collection of useful packages for data science work in R. [Data.table][data.table] is a complicated but extremely useful alternative to R’s standard data frames for storing and manipulating data. countrycode is a simple function for converting between different systems for encoding countries. At the R prompt from above, run:

```
> install.packages('tidyverse','data.table','countrycode')
```

You’re all set.
  
### Start the notebook

Navigate to the repository on the command line, and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

You should see a browser window pop up on `http://localhost:8888`. Click on “Big Mac data generator” to launch the notebook.

To run the notebook, you can run the code cell by cell by clicking on the first cell and using <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> to run each cell in turn. Or you can run the whole thing by clicking on the “Cell” menu and selecting “Run All”.
